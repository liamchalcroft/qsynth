## Overview

We present two novel methods for domain-agnostic stroke lesion segmentation:
1. **qATLAS**: A neural network that estimates qMRI maps from standard MPRAGE images
2. **qSynth**: A direct synthesis approach for qMRI maps using label-conditioned Gaussian mixture models

Both methods leverage physics-based forward models to ensure physical plausibility in the simulated images.
